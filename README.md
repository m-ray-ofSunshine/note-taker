# Note Taker

## Description

  This is a web app that utilizes a front end for taking notes and a back end for storing the notes.

## Installation

npm install

## Usage

This web app allows you to take notes and save them. You can add a note and fill out a title and body of the note. You can then click the save icon and it will be added to the side bar of notes. These notes will stay here even if you reload. The only way to get rid of the notes is to press the delete button next to the title of the note in the side bar.
